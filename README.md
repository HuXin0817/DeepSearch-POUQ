# DeepSearch

**DeepSearch** is a cross-platform C++ framework for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, with a focus on performance, scalability, and integration into AI-driven applications.

> ⚠️ This project is in its early development stage. APIs, performance, and features are subject to change.

## 🚀 Goals

- 🔄 **Cross-Platform**: Seamlessly runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for large-scale vector data.
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Easily plug in different indexing algorithms (HNSW, IVF, PQ, etc.).
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Friendly**: Supports integration with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX.
- 🌍 **Scalable**: Efficient for billion-scale datasets and supports distributed search.
- 📦 **Language Bindings**: Available in C++, Python, and RESTful API for service integration.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Coming soon: pip install deepsearch
